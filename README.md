My name is Elena and I am in my senior year of my undergraduate degree here at USF. This will be my last semester at USF, which will be quite bittersweet since I have enjoyed my time here. I am originally from Orlando, but I lived in Norway for quite some time and came back to the US to pursue an education in IO Psychology. I still have family over in Norway so I am hoping to visit soon when things get better.
